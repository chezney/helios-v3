## 📺 Watch It In Action (2-Minute Demo)

### Step 1: Start the System

```bash
cd tests/tier1
python test_tier1_with_database.py
```

### Step 2: Watch Real-Time Output

```
================================================================================
  TIER 1 COMPLETE PIPELINE TEST - WITH DATABASE
  WebSocket -> Candles -> PostgreSQL
================================================================================

[INIT] DatabaseWriter ready
[INIT] Aggregator ready with database integration
[INIT] WebSocket client ready

================================================================================
  STARTING DATA COLLECTION
================================================================================

Connecting to VALR exchange...
```

**What's happening?** The system is connecting to the VALR cryptocurrency exchange via WebSocket to receive live Bitcoin (BTCZAR) trades.

---

## 🔄 The Data Flow - Interactive Walkthrough

### 1️⃣ **WebSocket Connection** (First 2 seconds)

```
[WEBSOCKET] Connecting to wss://api.valr.com/ws/trade
[WEBSOCKET] ✓ Connected!
[WEBSOCKET] ✓ Subscribed to BTCZAR trades
```

**What just happened?**
- Opened a live connection to VALR exchange
- Subscribed to Bitcoin/ZAR (South African Rand) trading pair
- Started receiving real-time trade data

**Real Data Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "MARKET_SUMMARY_UPDATE",
  "currencyPairSymbol": "BTCZAR",
  "lastTradedPrice": "2019153.00",
  "askPrice": "2019154.00",
  "bidPrice": "2019152.00",
  "baseVolume": "0.00125"
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Trade Processing** (Continuous)

```
[PROGRESS] Trades: 50, Candles: 0
[PROGRESS] Trades: 100, Candles: 0
[PROGRESS] Trades: 150, Candles: 0
```

**What's happening?**
- Every time someone buys/sells Bitcoin on VALR, we receive a message
- Each trade has: price, quantity, timestamp, side (buy/sell)
- Trades are being collected but not yet formed into candles (need 1 minute of data)

**Real Trade Example:**
```python
MarketTick(
    pair='BTCZAR',
    price=2019153.00,      # R2,019,153 per Bitcoin
    quantity=0.00125,       # 0.00125 BTC traded
    side='BUY',
    timestamp=2025-10-01 13:18:45
)
```

---

### 3️⃣ **First Candle Created!** (After 1 minute)

```
[CANDLE] BTCZAR 1m @ 13:18:00 - O:R2,019,153 H:R2,019,153 L:R2,019,153 C:R2,019,153 (83 trades) -> DATABASE
```

**What just happened?** 🎉
- After 1 minute of collecting trades, the first candle was created!
- This is called an **OHLC candle** (Open, High, Low, Close)

**Let me explain each part:**

```
BTCZAR      = Trading pair (Bitcoin / South African Rand)
1m          = 1-minute timeframe
@ 13:18:00  = Candle started at 1:18 PM
O:R2,019,153 = OPEN price (first trade in this minute)
H:R2,019,153 = HIGH price (highest trade in this minute)
L:R2,019,153 = LOW price (lowest trade in this minute)
C:R2,019,153 = CLOSE price (last trade in this minute)
(83 trades) = Total number of trades in this candle
-> DATABASE = Successfully saved to PostgreSQL!
```

**Visual Representation:**

```
Time: 13:18:00 - 13:19:00 (1 minute)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Trades received: 83 trades

Trade 1:  R2,019,153  ← OPEN (first price)
Trade 15: R2,019,180  ← Some price
Trade 42: R2,019,200  ← HIGH (highest price)
Trade 56: R2,019,100  ← LOW (lowest price)
Trade 83: R2,019,153  ← CLOSE (last price)

This becomes ONE candle:
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ BTCZAR 1m @ 13:18:00          │
│ Open:  R2,019,153             │
│ High:  R2,019,200             │
│ Low:   R2,019,100             │
│ Close: R2,019,153             │
│ Volume: 1.025 BTC             │
│ Trades: 83                    │
└────────────────────────────────┘
       ↓
   DATABASE ✓
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Multi-Timeframe Magic** (After 5 minutes)

```
[CANDLE] BTCZAR 1m @ 13:19:00 - O:R2,019,153 H:R2,019,153 L:R2,018,845 C:R2,018,952 (574 trades) -> DATABASE

[CANDLE] BTCZAR 5m @ 13:15:00 - O:R2,019,153 H:R2,019,153 L:R2,018,845 C:R2,018,952 (657 trades) -> DATABASE
```

**What's happening?**
- We're creating candles for MULTIPLE timeframes simultaneously!
- **1m candles** = Every 1 minute
- **5m candles** = Every 5 minutes (combines 5× 1m candles)
- **15m candles** = Every 15 minutes (combines 15× 1m candles)

**Visual Example:**

```
TIME:   13:15    13:16    13:17    13:18    13:19    13:20
        ├────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
1m:     [candle1][candle2][candle3][candle4][candle5]
        └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
5m:              [    ONE BIG CANDLE    ]

Explanation:
- Each 1-minute box is a separate 1m candle
- The 5m candle combines all 5 of them:
  * OPEN = candle1's open
  * HIGH = highest of all 5 candles
  * LOW = lowest of all 5 candles
  * CLOSE = candle5's close
  * VOLUME = sum of all 5 volumes
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Database Persistence** (Continuous)

Every time a candle is created, it's immediately saved to PostgreSQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO market_ohlc (
    pair, timeframe, open_time, open_price, high_price,
    low_price, close_price, volume, num_trades
)
VALUES (
    'BTCZAR', '1m', '2025-10-01 13:18:00',
    2019153.00, 2019153.00, 2019153.00, 2019153.00,
    1.025, 83
);
```

**Why is this important?**
- ✅ Data survives if system crashes
- ✅ Can query historical data anytime
- ✅ Used by Tier 2 (neural network) for training
- ✅ Can backtest strategies

---

## 📊 Real Database Example

After the 2-minute test, you can see the data:

```bash
docker exec helios_postgres psql -U helios -d helios_v3 -c "
SELECT pair, timeframe, open_time, close_price, num_trades
FROM market_ohlc
ORDER BY open_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
"
```

**Actual Output:**

```
 pair  | timeframe |      open_time      | close_price  | num_trades
-------+-----------+---------------------+--------------+------------
BTCZAR | 1m        | 2025-10-01 13:19:00 | 2018952.00  |        574
BTCZAR | 1m        | 2025-10-01 13:18:00 | 2019153.00  |         83
BTCZAR | 1m        | 2025-10-01 13:17:00 | 2018672.00  |        555
BTCZAR | 1m        | 2025-10-01 13:16:00 | 2018048.00  |        335
BTCZAR | 5m        | 2025-10-01 13:15:00 | 2018952.00  |        657
```

**What does this tell us?**
- ✅ 4 one-minute candles stored
- ✅ 1 five-minute candle stored
- ✅ Bitcoin price was around R2,018,000 - R2,019,000
- ✅ Between 83-574 trades per minute (active market!)

## 🔬 Feature Engineering (The Secret Sauce)

While candles are being created, we calculate **90 technical indicators**:

### What Are Technical Indicators?

Think of them as "smart observations" about the market:

```python
# Example: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
# "What's the average price over the last 20 minutes?"

Candle 1: R2,019,000
Candle 2: R2,018,500
Candle 3: R2,019,200
...
Candle 20: R2,018,800

SMA_20 = (Sum of all 20 prices) / 20
       = R2,018,950  ← "Average trend"
```

### The 90 Features We Calculate:

**1. Price-Based (3 features)**
```python
return          = (current_price - previous_price) / previous_price
                = "Did price go up or down?"

log_return      = log(current_price / previous_price)
                = "Percentage change (normalized)"

normalized_price = (current_price - min_price) / (max_price - min_price)
                 = "Where is price in its range? (0-1)"
```

**2. Moving Averages (8 features)**
```python
SMA_5   = Average of last 5 candles     ← Short-term trend
SMA_10  = Average of last 10 candles
SMA_20  = Average of last 20 candles
SMA_50  = Average of last 50 candles    ← Long-term trend

EMA_5   = Weighted average (recent prices matter more)
EMA_10, EMA_20, EMA_50 = Same concept
```

**3. Momentum (7 features)**
```python
RSI = Relative Strength Index
    = "Is Bitcoin overbought (>70) or oversold (<30)?"

    Example:
    RSI = 75  → "Overbought! Might go down soon"
    RSI = 25  → "Oversold! Might bounce up"

MACD = Moving Average Convergence Divergence
     = "Are short and long trends converging or diverging?"

Stochastic = "Where is current price relative to recent range?"

ROC = Rate of Change
    = "How fast is price changing?"
```

**4. Volatility (4 features)**
```python
ATR = Average True Range
    = "How much does price typically move?"

    Example:
    ATR = R500 → "Price moves ~R500 per candle (low volatility)"
    ATR = R5000 → "Price swings R5000 per candle (high volatility!)"

Bollinger Bands = Price channel based on standard deviation
                = "Is price at the edge of 'normal' range?"

Historical Volatility = Standard deviation of returns
                      = "How unpredictable is the price?"
```

**5. Volume (3 features)**
```python
volume_sma = Average trading volume
           = "Is this a typical trading day?"

volume_ratio = current_volume / average_volume
             = "Is there unusually high activity?"

             Example:
             ratio = 3.5 → "350% more volume than usual!"

VWAP = Volume-Weighted Average Price
     = "What's the 'fair' price based on volume?"
```

**6. Microstructure (3 features)**
```python
spread = ask_price - bid_price
       = "How much does it cost to buy vs sell?"

       Example:
       Bid: R2,019,152 (someone wants to buy at this)
       Ask: R2,019,154 (someone wants to sell at this)
       Spread: R2 (very tight! liquid market)

depth_imbalance = bid_volume / (bid_volume + ask_volume)
                = "Are more people trying to buy or sell?"

tick_direction = +1 if last_price > previous_price else -1
               = "Did last trade push price up or down?"
```

**7. Statistical (2 features)**
```python
skewness = Measure of asymmetry
         = "Are big moves more often up or down?"

kurtosis = Measure of tail risk
         = "How likely are extreme price moves?"
```

### All 90 Features Organized:

```
TIMEFRAME   FEATURES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1-Minute    30 features (price, MA, RSI, etc.)
5-Minute    30 features (same calculations)
15-Minute   30 features (same calculations)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:      90 features → Input for ML model
```

## 🧪 Real Feature Calculation Example

Let's say we have this 1-minute candle:

```
BTCZAR 1m @ 13:18:00
Open:  R2,019,153
High:  R2,019,200
Low:   R2,019,100
Close: R2,019,153
Volume: 1.025 BTC
```

**Feature Calculation:**

```python
# 1. Return
previous_close = 2,019,000
current_close = 2,019,153
return = (2,019,153 - 2,019,000) / 2,019,000
       = 0.0000758 (0.00758% increase)

# 2. SMA_5 (need last 5 candles)
candles = [2,019,000, 2,018,500, 2,019,200, 2,018,800, 2,019,153]
SMA_5 = sum(candles) / 5
      = 2,018,930.60

# 3. RSI (simplified)
gains = [153, 0, 200, 0, 153]  # Up moves
losses = [0, 500, 0, 400, 0]   # Down moves
avg_gain = 101.2
avg_loss = 180.0
RS = avg_gain / avg_loss = 0.562
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
    = 35.98 → "Slightly oversold, might bounce up"

# ... 87 more features calculated!
```

**Result:**

```python
FeatureVector(
    pair='BTCZAR',
    timestamp='2025-10-01 13:18:00',
    features=numpy.array([
        0.0000758,    # return
        0.00012,      # log_return
        0.45,         # normalized_price
        2018930.60,   # SMA_5
        2018850.25,   # SMA_10
        # ... 85 more features
    ])
)
```

**This 90-number array is what the neural network (Tier 2) will use to predict future prices!**

## 🚀 How Tier 1 Enables Tier 2 (Neural Network)

```
TIER 1 OUTPUT                    TIER 2 INPUT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[1] OHLC Candles          →      Training Data
    stored in DB                 (historical candles)
                                        ↓
[2] 90 Features           →      Model Input
    per candle                   (feature vector)
                                        ↓
[3] Real-time stream      →      Live Predictions
    new candles                  (every 1/5/15 min)
```

**Example:**

```python
# Tier 1 provides this:
candle = {
    'pair': 'BTCZAR',
    'timeframe': '1m',
    'open': 2019153.00,
    'high': 2019200.00,
    'low': 2019100.00,
    'close': 2019153.00
}

features = [0.0000758, 0.00012, 0.45, 2018930.60, ...]  # 90 numbers

# Tier 2 uses it like this:
prediction = neural_network.predict(features)
# Returns: [price_direction, volatility, regime]
#          [+1 (up), 0.02 (2% expected move), 'TRENDING']
```

---

## 🎯 Try It Yourself!

### Interactive Exploration:

**1. Run the test:**
```bash
cd tests/tier1
python test_tier1_with_database.py
```

**2. While it's running, watch the database fill up:**
```bash
# In another terminal:
watch -n 5 "docker exec helios_postgres psql -U helios -d helios_v3 -c 'SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM market_ohlc;'"
```

**3. After it finishes, explore the data:**
```bash
# View candles
docker exec helios_postgres psql -U helios -d helios_v3 -c "
SELECT pair, timeframe, open_time, close_price, num_trades
FROM market_ohlc
ORDER BY open_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
"

# Count by timeframe
docker exec helios_postgres psql -U helios -d helios_v3 -c "
SELECT timeframe, COUNT(*) as candle_count
FROM market_ohlc
GROUP BY timeframe
ORDER BY timeframe;
"

# See price changes
docker exec helios_postgres psql -U helios -d helios_v3 -c "
SELECT
    open_time,
    close_price,
    close_price - LAG(close_price) OVER (ORDER BY open_time) as price_change
FROM market_ohlc
WHERE timeframe = '1m'
ORDER BY open_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

## 🎉 You Now Understand Tier 1!

**What we built:**
- ✅ WebSocket client that receives live Bitcoin trades
- ✅ Candle aggregator that creates 1m, 5m, 15m OHLC candles
- ✅ Feature engineer that calculates 90 technical indicators
- ✅ Database writer that persists everything to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Complete pipeline tested with real market data

**Why it matters:**
- This is the **foundation** for the entire trading system
- Without good data, the neural network (Tier 2) can't learn
- Without real-time processing, we can't trade in live markets
- Without persistence, we lose everything on crash

**Next step:**
- Build the neural network (Tier 2) that uses this data to predict prices!
