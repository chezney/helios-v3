## Active Sessions

### Session 2025-10-21: Skills System Creation

**Goal**:
- Create minimal, focused Skills system
- Learn from over-engineering mistakes
- Provide essential context without bloat

**Approach**:
1. Created comprehensive 11-file system (OVERKILL)
2. User questioned complexity
3. Deleted over-engineered Skills
4. Creating lean 3-Skill system

**Progress**:
- [x] Created SKILL.md (essential context)
- [ ] Create work-tracker.md (this file)
- [ ] Create gui-focus.md (user's priority)

**Thought Pattern**:
- Started with good intentions (avoid token waste)
- Over-engineered the solution (11 files!)
- Fell into same trap as main project (complexity creep)
- Learning: Start minimal, add only if needed
- Keeping it to 3 Skills maximum

**Interruptions**:
None yet

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete work-tracker.md
2. Create gui-focus.md for GUI development
3. Done - 3 Skills total

## Example Session (Reference)

### Session 2025-10-15: VALR Live Client Implementation

**Goal**:
- Implement `src/trading/execution/valr_trading_client.py`
- Enable real money trading on VALR exchange
- Complete missing 5% of system

**Approach**:
1. Read VALR API docs
2. Implement HMAC signature generation
3. Create market order execution
4. Add balance queries
5. Implement error handling
6. Write tests

**Progress**:
- [x] Created file structure
- [x] Implemented HMAC signature
- [x] Added place_market_order() method
- [ ] In progress: get_balance() method
- [ ] Pending: Error handling
- [ ] Pending: Integration tests

**Thought Pattern**:
- HMAC must use milliseconds (not seconds)
- VALR headers: X-VALR-API-KEY, X-VALR-SIGNATURE, X-VALR-TIMESTAMP
- Rate limit: 100 req/10sec
- Use aiohttp.ClientSession() for connection pooling

**Interruptions**:
- Bug #1: Database timeout during testing
  - Root cause: Long-running transaction
  - Fix: Added connection pool timeout config
  - Status: ‚úÖ Fixed
  - Time lost: 30 minutes

- Question: Support limit orders or just market orders?
  - Answer: Market orders only initially
  - Reasoning: Maintain parity with paper trading
  - Note: Add limit orders in future iteration

**Next Steps**:
1. Resume at: `valr_trading_client.py` line 156
2. Check: Verify HMAC signature works with balance endpoint
3. Then: Implement error handling for API failures

## Tips for Effective Tracking

### Progress Checkboxes
```markdown
- [ ] Not started
- [x] Completed
- [~] In progress (use if you want)
```

### Status Indicators
```
‚úÖ Complete
üöß In Progress
‚è≥ Deferred (will do later)
‚ùå Blocked (can't proceed)
üîÑ Paused (interrupted but will resume)
```

### Interruption Pattern
```markdown
**Interruptions**:
- Type: Bug/Question/User Request
- Description: What happened
- Root cause: Why it happened
- Fix: What was done
- Status: ‚úÖ Fixed / üöß In Progress / ‚è≥ Deferred
- Time impact: How long it took
```

## Benefits

**Without This**:
```
Start feature X
‚Üí Bug appears
‚Üí Fix bug
‚Üí "Where was I?"
‚Üí Re-read code, re-plan
‚Üí Lost 15-30 minutes
```

**With This**:
```
Start feature X (logged)
‚Üí Bug appears (logged in Interruptions)
‚Üí Fix bug (marked as fixed)
‚Üí Check "Next Steps"
‚Üí Resume at line 156 of file.py
‚Üí Lost 0 minutes
```
